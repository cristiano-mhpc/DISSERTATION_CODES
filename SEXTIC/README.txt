This folder contains the relevant codes used in the computation of the ground-state energy of the sextic anharmonic oscillator. The subfolder "1_5k_mom_1_5kdig" for instance contains the result of finite part integration using 1500 moments performed at 1500 digit precision. The folder "moments" contains code for generating perturbation coefficients for the Rayleigh-Schrodinger(RS) perturbation expansion. The folder "Pade" is the summation of the RS expansion via Pade Approximants. Please see the readme.pdf file in each subfolder for more information about the codes contained therein.
